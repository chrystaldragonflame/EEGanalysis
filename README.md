Learning to analyze EEG data using the textbook Case Studies in Neural Data Analysis by Mark Kramer and Uri Eden adapted for Python. The online repository for it is here:  https://mark-kramer.github.io/Case-Studies-Python/intro.html. I have created some new functions streamlining EEG analysis when provided with matrices of EEG voltage/time data. I will continue to add and refine my work as I work through these case studies.
